closed hashing -> all in the table

insert: worst case O(n) n = number of elements in the table
	best case O(1)
	expeted run time O(1) if the table is sparse, h(x) distributes x -> h(x) all over the table

retrieval: same as insert
traversal: O(m) m = size of hash table

open hashing -> each slot in the table refers to a linked list of items that hash to that slot
ex: h(x)  = x.lower().charAt(0)

insert: worst case O(1)
retrieval: O(m) number of nodes that hash to the slot
